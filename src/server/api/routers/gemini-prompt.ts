const prompt = `You are an AI assistant tasked with preparing text excerpts for a typing racer game. The text comes from user-uploaded documents, likely personal notes, articles, or informational PDFs focused on technical or academic subjects. The goal is to extract short, highly information-dense, self-contained statements that explain or define key concepts, suitable for typing practice.

**Crucial Objective: Emulate the style, density, and informational focus of the provided "Desired Output Examples" below.**

**Desired Output Examples (These are the gold standard):**
*   "paxos is a family of protocols ensuring distributed agreement despite node failures it guarantees safety by requiring a majority quorum for proposals and commits making it robust but complex"
*   "raft simplifies distributed consensus compared to paxos it uses leader election and replicated logs ensuring that all nodes agree on the sequence of operations in a fault tolerant manner"
*   "bft mechanisms allow distributed systems to reach consensus even when some nodes exhibit arbitrary malicious behavior byzantine faults unlike protocols assuming only crash failures"
*   "2pc coordinates atomic transactions across multiple distributed nodes it involves a prepare phase where nodes vote and a commitabort phase based on the vote outcome blocking is a risk"
*   "3pc aims to reduce 2pcs blocking issue during coordinator or node failures it adds a pre commit phase allowing non blocking recovery under certain failure scenarios"
*   "vector clocks track causality in distributed systems by assigning a vector timestamp to each event comparing vectors reveals if events are causally related concurrent or ordered"
*   "matrix clocks extend vector clocks enabling nodes to maintain knowledge about other nodes knowledge of event times this helps track more complex causal relationships and global states"
*   "lamport timestamps assign a logical clock value a simple counter to events establishing a total ordering consistent with causality concurrent events might get arbitrary order"
*   "hlcs combine physical clock time with logical counters they provide timestamps that reflect causality like lamport clocks but stay close to physical time for better observability"
*   "version vectors are used in replicated systems to track the history of updates for each replica they help detect and reconcile conflicting updates made concurrently"
*   "crdts are data structures designed for replication where concurrent updates can merge automatically without conflicts ensuring strong eventual consistency without complex coordination"

Instructions:
1.  **Analyze Context:** Read through the entire provided document text to understand its overall subject matter and the key concepts being discussed.
2.  **Identify Candidate Sentences/Short Passages:** Scan the text. Instead of looking for long paragraphs, focus on individual sentences or very short, cohesive passages (1-2 sentences max) that seem to define, explain, or characterize a specific term, concept, mechanism, or principle.
3.  **Prioritize for Density and Definition (Critical):**
    *   **Select for High Information Density:** Choose sentences/passages that pack significant meaning into few words. They should be rich with specific terminology and factual content.
    *   **Focus on Definitional/Explanatory Content:** Prioritize statements that answer "What is X?" or "How does X work?" or "What are the key features of X?". They should clearly articulate a core idea.
    *   **Ensure Self-Containment:** Each selected snippet should be understandable on its own without requiring surrounding context from the original document.
    *   **Look for Key Terminology:** The snippets should ideally revolve around, define, or explain important nouns or noun phrases (like "Paxos," "vector clocks," "BFT mechanisms").
    *   **Avoid:**
        *   Vague or overly general statements.
        *   Purely illustrative examples without a core definition (e.g., avoid "we are talking billions of images" *unless* it's part of a concise definition of "high data volume").
        *   Transitional phrases, conversational fillers, questions, or incomplete thoughts.
        *   Simple greetings/closings, repetitive filler.
        *   Sentences that primarily list keywords without explaining their relationships.
4.  **Exclude Non-Prose & Metadata:** Strictly exclude the following:
    *   Titles, chapter headings, section headers, subheadings.
    *   Tables of contents, indices, bibliographies, reference lists, footnotes, endnotes.
    *   Copyright notices, publisher details, author attributions (unless clearly part of the main informative text defining a concept).
    *   Page numbers, running headers, footers.
    *   Figure captions, table titles/labels.
    *   Standalone bullet points or numbered list items (unless an item *itself* forms a complete, dense statement like the examples).
    *   Code blocks, mathematical formulas, or heavily formatted data unsuitable for typing.
    *   Very short fragments (e.g., less than 10 words) that don't convey a complete, dense idea.
5.  **Clean for Typing:** For each selected snippet:
    *   Remove any leading/trailing whitespace.
    *   Normalize internal whitespace to single spaces between words.
    *   Ensure standard punctuation. Correct run-on sentences if a simple punctuation addition makes two short, related sentences into a valid snippet (but prefer naturally well-formed single sentences). Remove awkward line breaks within sentences.
    *   Convert all text to lowercase.
    *   Remove any residual formatting artifacts.
6.  **Filter by Length:** Ensure the final cleaned snippets are concise, ideally between **15 and 40 words**. This range reflects the density of the "Desired Output Examples". Adjust slightly if needed, but the goal is conciseness.
7.  **Format Output:** Return a list of the cleaned, information-dense snippets that meet all criteria. Format the output as a JSON list of strings. Provide [Specify Number, e.g., 'up to 15' or 'all suitable'] snippets.

Example of bad output to avoid (too conversational, not definitional):
"high data volume: weâ€™re talking billions of images or millions of customer interactions"
